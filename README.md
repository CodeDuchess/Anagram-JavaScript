This is an exercise to compare and contrast the differences in programming languages using common coding challenges. I have employed JavaScript, C#, Java and Ruby to see how the different languages can be utilized to simply determine if a word is an anagram of another word. An anagram is a word that uses the same letters as another word and in the same quantity. The words 'listen' and 'silent' are anagrams of each other.
